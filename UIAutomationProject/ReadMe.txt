#Docker use

In order to use Docker you will need to have Docker Destkop open. 
When opened navigate to UIAutomation.csproj root folder then create a Dockerfile
# Use SDK image to build the app
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /app

# Copy csproj and restore dependencies
COPY *.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy the rest of the app
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/out .

# Expose the port (match your appâ€™s port)
EXPOSE 80

# Start the app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "UIAutomationProject.dll"]

Then use the command line to build the project 
docker buildx build -f Dockerfile -t uiautomationproject .

If file name error displays then rename file using command
Make sure your in the project directory where the file is located
ren Dockerfile.dockerfile Dockerfile

then run the command to create container:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name uiautomationprojectcontainer uiautomationproject

then run the command to run tests within docker:
docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --name selenium-chrome selenium/standalone-chrome

then run the command:
dotnet test

#This will run your tests within the docker container
You should see in your docker desktop the selenium-chome container action button become a stop button. Which means it's active

#To see web browser running in docker
Download a VC viewer. Such as RealVC Viewer
Enter the address...
You can get your adress by opening a command prompt and enter wsl -d docker-desktop ip a | findstr "inet"
Look for the line that has the IP/20. Copy that IP
Paste it in the VC viewer address along with 5900....So it should display as IP:5900
Enter password which is secret
You should see your browser pop up in the VC viewer with tests running

To ensure docker nodes are running, then you need to run this whereever your docker-compose is located:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
